   - [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/submissions/875366309/)

## Explanation

> In this , 5 is the limiting factor so we just need to get count of 5 in n!
>
> we can use n/5 to get count of 5 in n! and add it to our answer and increase the denominator power of 5 so : n/5 , n/25 , n/125 and so on
>
> at end the sum of all is the ans;
>
>  Time-Complexity: O(log(n))

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int ans = 0,i = 5;
        while(i <= n) {
            ans += n/i;
            i *=5;
        };
        return ans;
    }
};
```
